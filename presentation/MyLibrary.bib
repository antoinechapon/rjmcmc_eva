	abstract = {During the late 1990s, Huang introduced the algorithm called Empirical Mode Decomposition, which is widely used today to recursively decompose a signal into different modes of unknown but separate spectral bands. {EMD} is known for limitations like sensitivity to noise and sampling. These limitations could only partially be addressed by more mathematical attempts to this decomposition problem, like synchrosqueezing, empirical wavelets or recursive variational decomposition. Here, we propose an entirely non-recursive variational mode decomposition model, where the modes are extracted concurrently. The model looks for an ensemble of modes and their respective center frequencies, such that the modes collectively reproduce the input signal, while each being smooth after demodulation into baseband. In Fourier domain, this corresponds to a narrow-band prior. We show important relations to Wiener filter denoising. Indeed, the proposed method is a generalization of the classic Wiener filter into multiple, adaptive bands. Our model provides a solution to the decomposition problem that is theoretically well founded and still easy to understand. The variational model is efficiently optimized using an alternating direction method of multipliers approach. Preliminary results show attractive performance with respect to existing mode decomposition models. In particular, our proposed model is much more robust to sampling and noise. Finally, we show promising practical decomposition results on a series of artificial and real data.},

	doi = {10.1061/(ASCE)HE.1943-5584.0000820},
	abstract = {Current practice using probabilistic methods applied for designing hydraulic structures generally assume that extreme events are stationary. However, many studies in the past decades have shown that hydrological records exhibit some type of nonstationarity such as trends and shifts. Human intervention in river basins (e.g., urbanization), the effect of low-frequency climatic variability (e.g., Pacific Decadal Oscillation), and climate change due to increased greenhouse gasses in the atmosphere have been suggested to be the leading causes of changes in the hydrologic cycle of river basins in addition to changes in the magnitude and frequency of extreme floods and extreme sea levels. To tackle nonstationarity in hydrologic extremes, several approaches have been proposed in the literature such as frequency analysis, in which the parameters of a given model vary in accordance with time. The aim of this paper is to show that some basic concepts and methods used in designing flood-related hydraulic structures assuming a stationary world can be extended into a nonstationary frame- work. In particular, the concepts of return period and risk are formulated by extending the geometric distribution to allow for changing exceeding probabilities over time. Building on previous developments suggested in the statistical and climate change literature, the writers present a simple and unified framework to estimate the return period and risk for nonstationary hydrologic events along with examples and applications so that it can be accessible to a broad audience in the field. The applications demonstrate that the return period and risk estimates for nonstationary situations can be quite different than those corresponding to stationary conditions. They also suggest that the nonstationary analysis can be helpful in making an appropriate assessment of the risk of a hydraulic structure during the planned project-life. {DOI}: 10.1061/ ({ASCE}){HE}.1943-5584.0000820. © 2014 American Society of Civil Engineers.},

Since climate indices or their associated hydrometeorological variables might contain nonstationary oscillation processes, it would be useful to be able to divide the intrinsic nonstationary oscillation into a finite number of components. Those components can then be used to predict the future system evolution. In the current study nonstationary oscillations of certain time series are extracted using a decomposition analysis called the empirical mode decomposition ({EMD}). In {EMD} the most important components are modeled with a nonstationary oscillation resampling ({NSOR}) technique. To predict a long-term oscillation pattern, a time series with a long record is required. The normalized regional precipitation of eastern Canada is one such series. In a second example, the future evolution of extreme streamflows at two stations from the province of Quebec, Canada, is studied by using the long-term patterns of climatic indices. Results indicate that the future long-term patterns are well-modeled with the {NSOR} and {EMD}.

	abstract = {Determining trend and implementing detrending operations are important steps in data analysis. Yet there is no precise definition of “trend” nor any logical algorithm for extracting it. As a result, various ad hoc extrinsic methods have been used to determine trend and to facilitate a detrending operation. In this article, a simple and logical definition of trend is given for any nonlinear and nonstationary time series as an intrinsically determined monotonic function within a certain temporal span (most often that of the data span), or a function in which there can be at most one extremum within that temporal span. Being intrinsic, the method to derive the trend has to be adaptive. This definition of trend also presumes the existence of a natural time scale. All these requirements suggest the Empirical Mode Decomposition ({EMD}) method as the logical choice of algorithm for extracting various trends from a data set. Once the trend is determined, the corresponding detrending operation can be implemented. With this definition of trend, the variability of the data on various time scales also can be derived naturally. Climate data are used to illustrate the determination of the intrinsic trend and natural variability.

Traditional hydrological frequency analysis methods do not account for year to year shifts in flood risk distributions that arise due to changes in exogenous factors that affect the causal structure of flood risk. We use Hierarchical Bayesian Analysis to evaluate several factors that influence the frequency of extreme floods for a basin in Montana. Sea surface temperatures, predicted {GCM} precipitation, climate indices and snow pack depth are considered as potential predictors of flood risk. The parameters of the flood risk prediction model are estimated using a Markov Chain Monte Carlo algorithm. The predictors are compared in terms of the resulting posterior distributions of the parameters that are used to estimate flood frequency distributions. The analysis shows an approach for exploiting the link between climate scale indicators and annual maximum flood, providing impetus for developing seasonal forecasting of flood risk application and dynamic flood risk management strategies.},

	abstract = {Frequency analysis is a technique of fitting a probability distribution to a series of observations for defining the probabilities of future occurrences of some events of interest, e.g., an estimate of a flood magnitude corresponding to a chosen risk of failure. The use of this technique has played an important role in engineering practice. The assumptions of independence and stationarity are necessary conditions to proceed with such analyses. However, in the context of climate change, it is possible that these assumptions would no longer hold and the results of conventional frequency analysis would become doubtful. Under such circumstances, it is important that recourse be made to other suitable approaches which incorporate non-independence and non-stationarity of hydro-meteorological extremes. In paper, a brief review of the current approaches to these issues is presented. Approaches that remove the effect of serial dependence to obtain independent observations are presented and the ones that involve kernel or wavelet-based probability density estimation are only discussed for frequency analysis of dependent observations. For frequency analysis of non-stationary observations, the reviewed approaches include the extremal, r-largest, peaks-over-threshold, time-varying moments, pooled flood frequency analysis, local likelihood and quantile regression. Synthesis of the reviewed approaches is presented, issues related to establishing non-stationary behavior are discussed and future challenges in frequency analysis of hydro-meteorological extremes are discussed as well. Extensions to some of the reviewed approaches and new avenues of research have been identified for further development and improvement. It is also concluded that, to be most useful, non-stationarity considerations be incorporated into new risk assessment frameworks.},

The French authorities remain cautious by adopting a strict policy of nuclear-plants flood prevention. Although coastal nuclear facilities in France are designed to very low probabilities of failure (e.g., 1000-year surge), exceptional surges (outliers induced by exceptional climatic events) have shown that the extreme sea levels estimated with the current statistical approaches could be underestimated. The estimation of extreme surges then requires the use of a statistical analysis approach having a more solid theoretical motivation. This paper deals with extreme-surge frequency estimation using historical information ({HI}) about events occurred before the systematic record period. It also contributes to addressing the problem of the presence of outliers in data sets. The frequency models presented in the present paper have been quite successful in the field of hydrometeorology and river flooding but they have not been applied to sea level data sets to prevent marine flooding. {\textless}br{\textgreater}{\textless}br{\textgreater} In this work, we suggest two methods of incorporating the {HI}: the peaks-over-threshold method with {HI} ({POTH}) and the block maxima method with {HI} ({BMH}). Two kinds of historical data can be used in the {POTH} method: classical historical maxima ({HMax}) data, and over-a-threshold supplementary ({OTS}) data. In both cases, the data are structured in historical periods and can be used only as complement to the main systematic data. On the other hand, in the {BMH} method, the basic hypothesis in statistical modeling of {HI} is that at least one threshold of perception exists for the whole period (historical and systematic) and that during a giving historical period preceding the period of tide gauging, only information about surges above this threshold have been recorded or archived. The two frequency models were applied to a case study from France, at the La Rochelle site where the storm Xynthia induced an outlier, to illustrate their potentials, to compare their performances and especially to analyze the impact of the use of {HI} on the extreme-surge frequency estimation.},

	abstract = {Water managers need non-stationary tools to better characterize precipitation extremes. Statistical approaches based on extreme value theory ({EVT}) are increasingly being used, but few end-to-end generalized workflows are available. In this paper, a step-by-step framework is demonstrated for developing an {EVT} model that considers the influence of dominant weather patterns on precipitation extremes in a watershed. Specifically, the Point Process ({PP}) model is utilized, which is a unified statistical framework for modeling the frequency and magnitude of extremes above a threshold. Because threshold selection can be subjective, a demonstration of how to go about selecting a threshold is provided; in particular, by examining a range of thresholds. The workflow is applied to daily precipitation from the Rio Grande watershed in New Mexico. In this arid watershed, extreme precipitation events substantially contribute to total runoff. An improved understanding of the drivers and extent of changes in extreme precipitation is essential for water resource and risk management. In addition to a stationary {PP} model without covariates, several covariates are examined for inclusion in the location and scale parameters. The significance of including the covariates is assessed, as well as several additional criteria, including if the covariate(s) make intuitive sense and if it is a good candidate for statistical downscaling (i.e., methods that relate large-scale variables to the local scale). A final {PP} model is selected that includes the wet weather types in the location and scale parameters. This model is applied in a downscaling context using a large ensemble of climate projections, which shows that the frequency of exceeding a high threshold increases after 2050, but the conditional likelihood of exceeding the maximum observed precipitation stays relatively constant.},

For a better associated risk assessment, the dependence structure between these variables must be taken into account by considering copulas. Multiparameter copulas (M-copulas) play an important role by their flexibility and ability to capture more than one type of dependence. Since model misspecification can lead to underestimation or overestimation of the associated risk, it is of high importance to select the appropriate copula. To this end, several goodness-of-fit ({GOF}) tests have been proposed. However, these tests are applied, validated and evaluated for the usual one-parameter copulas. Nevertheless, there is no specific {GOF} test for M-copulas that takes into account the specificities of hydrometeorological series. Hence, the aim of the present paper is to introduce new {GOF} tests specifically for M-copulas and adapted to hydrometeorological context. More precisely, the proposed {GOF} tests are based on multivariate L-moments. A simulation study is conducted to evaluate and compare the performances of the proposed tests. The results confirm the usefulness of the new {GOF} tests in comparison with some well-established ones. Finally, the newly introduced tests are illustrated on hydrometeorological data series.},

            Compound climate extremes are receiving increasing attention because of their disproportionate impacts on humans and ecosystems. However, risks assessments generally focus on univariate statistics. We analyze the co-occurrence of hot and dry summers and show that these are correlated, inducing a much higher frequency of concurrent hot and dry summers than what would be assumed from the independent combination of the univariate statistics. Our results demonstrate how the dependence structure between variables affects the occurrence frequency of multivariate extremes. Assessments based on univariate statistics can thus strongly underestimate risks associated with given extremes, if impacts depend on multiple (dependent) variables. We conclude that a multivariate perspective is necessary to appropriately assess changes in climate extremes and their impacts and to design adaptation strategies.},

	abstract = {It is now widely recognized that El Niño-Southern Oscillation ({ENSO}) occurs in more than one form, with the canonical eastern Pacific ({EP}) and more recently recognized central Pacific ({CP}) {ENSO} types receiving the most focus. Given that these various {ENSO} "flavors" may contribute to climate variability and long-term trends in unique ways, and that {ENSO} variability is not limited to these two types, this study presents a framework that treats {ENSO} as a continuum but determines a finite maximum number of statistically distinguishable representative {ENSOpatterns}. Aneural network-based cluster analysis called self-organizing map ({SOM}) analysis paired with a statistical distinguishability test determines nine unique patterns that characterize the September-February tropical Pacific {SST} anomaly fields for the period from 1950 through 2011. These nine patterns represent the flavors of {ENSO}, which include {EP}, {CP}, and mixed {ENSO} patterns. Over the 1950-2011 period, the most significant trends reflect changes in La Niña patterns, with a shift in dominance of La Niña-like patterns with weak or negative western Pacific warm pool {SST} anomalies until the mid-1970s, followed by a dominance of La Niña-like patterns with positive western Pacific warm pool {SST} anomalies, particularly after the mid-1990s. Both an {EP} and especially a {CP} El Niño pattern experienced positive frequency trends, but these trends are indistinguishable fromnatural variability. Overall, changes in frequencywithin the {ENSO} continuum contributed to the pattern of tropical Pacific warming, particularly in the equatorial eastern Pacific and especially in relation to changes of La Niña-like rather than El Niño-like patterns.},

	abstract = {Many policy-makers view nuclear power as a mitigation for climate change. Efforts to mitigate and adapt to climate change, however, interact with existing and new nuclear power plants, and these installations must contend with dilemmas between adaptation and mitigation. This paper develops five criteria to assess the adaptation–mitigation dilemma on two major points: (1) the ability of nuclear power to adapt to climate change and (2) the potential for nuclear power operation to hinder climate change adaptation. Sea level rise models for nine coastal sites in the United States, a review of {US} Nuclear Regulatory Commission documents, and reports from France’s nuclear regulatory agency provided insights into issues that have arisen from sea level rise, shoreline erosion, coastal storms, floods, and heat waves. Applying the criteria to inland and coastal nuclear power plants reveals several weaknesses. Safety stands out as the primary concern at coastal locations, while inland locations encounter greater problems with interrupted operation. Adapting nuclear power to climate change entails either increased expenses for construction and operation or incurs significant costs to the environment and public health and welfare. Mere absence of greenhouse gas emissions is not sufficient to assess nuclear power as a mitigation for climate change.},

This study employs panel dynamic Generalised Method of Moments ({GMM}) and panel Fully Modified Ordinary Least Squares ({FMOLS}) to investigate the effects of electricity production from nuclear source, electricity production from non-renewables and trade openness on {CO}2 emissions. The empirical findings suggest that {EKC} hypothesis is valid in {OECD} countries where nuclear energy plays a pivotal role in protecting the environment. On the contrary, non-renewable energy sources tend to increase {CO}2 emissions. Our results support the notion that electricity generated by nuclear source leads to lower {CO}2 emissions without retarding the long run growth in {OECD} countries. The findings also provide important policy insights and recommendations not only for {OECD} countries, but also for developing countries in designing appropriate energy and economic policies.},

	abstract = {A crucial aspect of threshold-based extreme value analyses is the level at which the threshold is set. For a suitably high threshold asymptotic theory suggests that threshold excesses may be modelled by a generalized Pareto distribution. A common threshold diagnostic is a plot of estimates of the generalized Pareto shape parameter over a range of thresholds. The aim is to select the lowest threshold above which the estimates are judged to be approximately constant, taking into account sampling variability summarized by pointwise confidence intervals. This approach doesn’t test directly the hypothesis that the underlying shape parameter is constant above a given threshold, but requires the user subjectively to combine information from many dependent estimates and confidence intervals. We develop tests of this hypothesis based on a multiple-threshold penultimate model that generalizes a two-threshold model proposed recently. One variant uses only the model fits from the traditional parameter stability plot. This is particularly beneficial when many datasets are analysed and enables assessment of the properties of the test on simulated data. We assess and illustrate these tests on river flow rate data and 72 series of significant wave heights.},

This approach involves the selection of a high threshold above which the model fits the data well. Sometimes, few observations of a measurement process might be recorded in applications and so selecting a high quantile of the sample as the threshold leads to almost no exceedances. In this paper we propose extensions of the generalised Pareto distribution that incorporate an additional shape parameter while keeping the tail behaviour unaffected. The inclusion of this parameter offers additional structure for the main body of the distribution, improves the stability of the modified scale, tail index and return level estimates to threshold choice and allows a lower threshold to be selected. We illustrate the benefits of the proposed models with a simulation study and two case studies.},

This paper summarizes the contribution of their authors to a few strategic studies, research workshops, development forum and international conferences related to Climate and Energy. It presents a review of the impacts that climate change may have throughout the energy chain and identifies current knowledge gaps and areas for future research development. One of the greatest challenges is how to assess impacts which may occur as a consequence of the projected increase in the intensity of extreme weather events: the majority of current methodologies rely on past experience but this may not be a sufficiently good guide for planning and operational activities in the coming decades. Also, climate impact assessments on energy planning and operation need to take into account a greater number of scenarios, as well as investigate impacts on particular energy segments. Therefore, we identify energy segments for which little climate impact research has been conducted. Finally, because climate impact assessment for energy systems is a relatively new research field, it is expected that methodological developments will increase in the near future with a consequent broadening of the knowledge base on the subject.},

The paper starts with a discussion of energy security, and breaks it down into four main categories of threat. These include threats due to fossil fuel scarcity and external disruptions, problems due to a lack of investment in infrastructure, threats due to technology or infrastructure failure, and risks due to domestic activism or terrorism. The paper then discusses one of the most common strategies put forward to improve security—the promotion of diversity within energy systems. Following this, the paper assesses the potential for new nuclear investment to ameliorate security threats in each of the four categories introduced earlier in the paper. The paper concludes that whilst nuclear investment can help to mitigate some threats to {UK} energy security, the government's case for supporting this investment ignores some equally important security issues. As a result, the energy security case for nuclear power has not yet been made.},

	abstract = {Natural hazards such as extreme wind, rainfall and ocean waves can have severe impacts on built and natural environments, contributing to the occurrence of disastrous events in some cases. These hazards are often caused by weather systems such as cyclones, fronts and thunderstorms. Previous studies typically examine one type of hazard and/or one type of weather system, with some studies in recent years starting to focus on compound hazards. Here we systematically examine compound hazards (extreme precipitation, extreme wind gusts, and extreme waves) from a weather system typology perspective. Cyclones and fronts are identified automatically from {ERA}-Interim reanalysis data, and thunderstorm events are based on lightning observations from 2005 to 2015, defining the study period. Relationships are examined over this period between the different compound hazard types and the weather system types, globally for different seasons. Most of the individual and compound hazards are most likely to be associated with the front-only or cyclone and front weather system types, while in the tropics, most hazards are strongly associated with the thunderstorm-only type. Despite being less frequent than the double weather system types, the triple weather system type shows comparable importance for many of the hazards, and especially the triple hazard. Individual case studies are examined using this compound event framework. It is intended that a greater understanding of compound hazards and the weather systems that cause them in regions throughout the world will help lead to improved preparedness and disaster risk reduction, given the importance of this for our rapidly changing world.},

	abstract = {Environmental measurements generate great volumes of high-dimensional data (often noisy and with missing values) from which meaningful messages may be extracted through appropriate organisation and summarisation. The self-organizing map ({SOM}) is an artificial neural network popular for recognizing patterns, relationships and clusters in such data. Through the finetuning of configuration and training parameters, the {SOM} can be tailored to best suit a specific data set. Presently, most hydrologic applications continue to rely on heuristics, software defaults or arbitrarily chosen parameters, forfeiting some of the potential benefits of the method, and often resulting in an output that does not best represent the actual features of the data. This paper guides researchers through the knowledgeable creation and interpretation of an appropriately customised {SOM} relevant to their particular high-dimensional, nonlinear data set. An understanding of the effects that parameter selection and training options have on the extracted information is developed, practical guidance is given for appropriately modifying parameter sets, and comparisons are made with closely-related methods. Data pre-processing, parameter selection, initialisation, training, visualisation and interpretation of the output map for pattern extraction and clustering are discussed. Through individually customised {SOMs}, more meaningful information can be gained from data-driven exploratory analysis of the inter-component relationships involved in water resource systems.},

	abstract = {Abstract
            The conventional approach to evaluating the joint statistical significance of multiple hypothesis tests (i.e., “field,” or “global,” significance) in meteorology and climatology is to count the number of individual (or “local”) tests yielding nominally significant results and then to judge the unusualness of this integer value in the context of the distribution of such counts that would occur if all local null hypotheses were true. The sensitivity (i.e., statistical power) of this approach is potentially compromised both by the discrete nature of the test statistic and by the fact that the approach ignores the confidence with which locally significant tests reject their null hypotheses. An alternative global test statistic that has neither of these problems is the minimum p value among all of the local tests. Evaluation of field significance using the minimum local p value as the global test statistic, which is also known as the Walker test, has strong connections to the joint evaluation of multiple tests in a way that controls the “false discovery rate” ({FDR}, or the expected fraction of local null hypothesis rejections that are incorrect). In particular, using the minimum local p value to evaluate field significance at a level αglobal is nearly equivalent to the slightly more powerful global test based on the {FDR} criterion. An additional advantage shared by Walker’s test and the {FDR} approach is that both are robust to spatial dependence within the field of tests. The {FDR} method not only provides a more broadly applicable and generally more powerful field significance test than the conventional counting procedure but also allows better identification of locations with significant differences, because fewer than αglobal × 100\% (on average) of apparently significant local tests will have resulted from local null hypotheses that are true.},

paucity of data, local statistical analyses often lead to poor frequency

The regional frequency analysis ({RFA}) reduces the uncertainties associated with these estimations by extending the dataset from local (only available data at the target site) to regional (data at all the neighboring sites including the target site) and by assuming, at the scale of a region, a similar extremal behavior. In this work, the empirical spatial extremogram ({ESE}) approach is used. This is a graph representing all the coefficients of extremal dependence between a given target site and all the other sites in the whole region. It allows quantifying the pairwise closeness between sites based on the extremal dependence. The {ESE} approach, which should help with have more confidence in the physical homogeneity of the region of interest, is applied on a database of extreme skew storm surges ({SSSs}) and used to perform a {RFA}.},

	abstract = {The warming observed over the past summers since 2000 is unprecedented in climate records in Europe and especially in France. Extreme temperatures and heat spells were often analyzed in the literature by applying extreme value theory but rarely in a non-stationary ({NS}) framework and duration modeling is often excluded. For a modern risk-based approach, it is important to have knowledge of the duration, magnitude, and frequency of occurrence of heat spells in a climate variability and change context. Yet, despite their obvious importance, teleconnections and associated climate indices ({CIs}) have often been excluded from heat spell modelling. The notion of duration is also not easily interpretable in a frequency analysis and can even be subtle, especially in a {NS} context. In this study, we used time-varying statistical distributions with parameters conditional on covariates representing the time and {CIs}. The daily maximum temperatures ({DMTs}) observed at the Orange and Dijon stations in France were used as a case study. This paper highlights a possible relationship between some large-scale climate patterns and the heat spells in France. Overall, the results suggest that considering the combined effect of global warming and these patterns in {NS} models is useful for a more appropriate characterization of the hazard heat spells in France.},

Motivated by these situations, a Bayesian estimation procedure for self-exciting point processes with missing histories is developed. The method naturally handles the missing data mechanism probabilistically through a specific step and is demonstrated on simulated data and a real conflict monitoring data where records over a period of time have been lost.},

	abstract = {In statistics, extreme events are often defined as excesses above a given large threshold. This definition allows hydrologists and flood planners to apply Extreme-Value Theory ({EVT}) to their time series of interest. Even in the stationary univariate context, this approach has at least two main drawbacks. First, working with excesses implies that a lot of observations (those below the chosen threshold) are completely disregarded. The range of precipitation is artificially shopped down into two pieces, namely large intensities and the rest, which necessarily imposes different statistical models for each piece. Second, this strategy raises a nontrivial and very practical difficultly: how to choose the optimal threshold which correctly discriminates between low and heavy rainfall intensities. To address these issues, we propose a statistical model in which {EVT} results apply not only to heavy, but also to low precipitation amounts (zeros excluded). Our model is in compliance with {EVT} on both ends of the spectrum and allows a smooth transition between the two tails, while keeping a low number of parameters. In terms of inference, we have implemented and tested two classical methods of estimation: likelihood maximization and probability weighed moments. Last but not least, there is no need to choose a threshold to define low and high excesses. The performance and flexibility of this approach are illustrated on simulated and hourly precipitation recorded in Lyon, France.},

	abstract = {In environmental applications it is common for the extremes of a variable to be non-stationary, varying systematically in space, time or with the values of covariates. Multi-site datasets are common, and in such cases there is likely to be non-negligible inter-site dependence. We consider applications in which multi-site data are used to infer the marginal behaviour of the extremes at individual sites, while adjusting for inter-site dependence. For reasons of statistical efficiency, it is standard to model exceedances of a high threshold. Choosing an appropriate threshold can be problematic, particularly if the extremes are non-stationary. We propose a method for setting a covariate-dependent threshold using quantile regression. We consider how the quantile regression model and extreme value models fitted to threshold exceedances should be parameterized, in order that they are compatible. We adjust estimates of uncertainty for spatial dependence using methodology proposed recently. These methods are illustrated using time series of storm peak significant wave heights from 72 sites in the Gulf of Mexico.

	abstract = {The characteristics of hindcast data for extreme storms at a Northern North Sea location are shown to depend on storm direction, reflecting storm strength and fetch variability. Storm peak H S over threshold is modeled using a generalized Pareto distribution, the parameters of which are allowed to vary smoothly with direction using a Fourier form. A directionally varying extreme value threshold is incorporated. The degree of smoothness of extreme value shape and scale with direction is regulated by roughness-penalized maximum likelihood, the optimal value of roughness selected by cross-validation. The characteristics of a 100-year storm peak H S , estimated using the directional model, differ from those estimated when ignoring the directionality of storms. In particular, the extreme right-hand tail of omnidirectional H S100 is longer using the directional model, indicating in this case that ignoring directionality causes underestimation of design criteria. Al-though storm peak data alone are used for extreme value modeling, the influence of a storm, in directional design sectors other than that containing its storm peak direction, is incorporated by estimating the storm's directional dissipation directly from the data. An automated approach to selection of directional design sectors is described. Directional design criteria are developed using three different approaches, all consistent with an omnidirectional storm peak H S nonexceedence probability of 0.5. We suggest a risk-cost criterion, which minimizes design cost for a given omnidirectional design specification, as an objective basis for optimal selection of directional criteria.},

By analyzing an 850-year global climate model simulation of the last millennium it is shown that the variations in the spatial structure of the {NAO} can be linked to the Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation ({AMO}). The {AMO} changes the zonal position of the {NAO} centers of action, moving them closer to Europe or North America. During {AMO}+ states, the Icelandic Low moves further towards North America while the Azores High moves further towards Europe and vice versa for {AMO}- states. The results of a regional downscaling for the East Atlantic/European domain show that {AMO}-induced changes in the spatial structure of the {NAO} reduce or enhance its influence on regional climate variables of the Baltic Sea such as sea surface temperature, ice extent, or river runoff.},

	abstract = {Variational mode decomposition ({VMD}) has attracted a lot of attention recently owing to its robustness to sampling frequency and its high-frequency resolution. However, its performance highly depends on two key preset parameters (the mode number K and the penalty parameter α), both of which tightly limit its adaptability and applications. In this study, a self-tuning {VMD} ({SVMD}) is proposed to tackle this problem. Within the proposed method, K and α update themselves respectively and adaptively via the energy ratio and orthogonality between modes in the frequency domain. The proposed {SVMD} is similar to a matching pursuit method and it shows a {VMD}-like equivalent filter bank structure but with much less mode-mixing probability. We show that {SVMD} is more robust to both changes in α and noise level than the original {VMD}; also, it has better convergence and reduces mode-mixing and end-effect. The experiments on {SVMD} indicate that {SVMD} outmatches several classic signal decomposition algorithms. In the end, real-world applications in three fields, namely, length of day variation analysis in geophysics, climate cycle study in meteorology, and oscillation detection in process control, are provided to demonstrate the effectiveness and advantages of the proposed {SVMD}.},

	abstract = {Reliable and accurate streamflow forecasting is vital for water resource management. Many streamflow prediction studies have demonstrated the excellent prediction ability of decomposition ensemble models. Several studies first extracted subsignals from a streamflow series and then split subsignals into training and validation sets to build prediction models, capturing some future information not available in practical streamflow forecasting. Alternatively, dividing a time series into training and validation sets first and later decomposing them into subsignals can expose the subsignals to the boundary effect, making predicting streamflow difficult. Furthermore, building one model for each subsignal is laborious and can cause error accumulation. Therefore, establishing a robust and efficient decomposition ensemble model without future information to predict highly nonstationary and nonlinear streamflow is challenging. Hence, a single-model forecasting ({SF}) scheme that assesses the validation distribution during the training stage to adapt to the boundary effect was designed. A {SF} scheme based on variational mode decomposition ({VMD}) and long short-term memory ({LSTM}), namely, {SF}-{VMD}-{LSTM}, was proposed to predict daily streamflow 1–7 days ahead. Non-decomposition-based and decomposition-ensemble-based {LSTM} models established using {SF}, multi-model ensemble forecasting ({MEF}) and {SF} with the most influential subsignals ({SFMIS}) and the ensemble empirical mode decomposition ({EEMD}) and discrete wavelet transform ({DWT}) were compared. Additionally, multi-model ensemble hindcasting ({MEH}), single-model hindcasting ({SH}) and {SH} with the most influential subsignals ({SHMIS}) were used as benchmarks to evaluate the forecasting schemes’ adaptability to the boundary effect. Two daily streamflow series from Han River and Jing River, China, were investigated. The results indicate that (1) {SF} is more robust and efficient than {MEF} and {SFMIS}; (2) {VMD} performs better than {EEMD} and {DWT}; (3) {SF}-{VMD}-{LSTM}, with {NSE} values larger than 0.8 for almost all the prediction scenarios, outperformed other comparative models. Therefore, {SF}-{VMD}-{LSTM} is robust and efficient for forecasting highly nonstationary and nonlinear streamflow.},

Observations, modeling and paleo data provide evidence of a strong link between the atmospheric and physical oceanographic variability in these northern regions with Atlantic sea surface temperatures farther south as expressed by the Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation ({AMO}). Air and sea temperatures over the past 100–150years reveal cool periods in the late 1800s to early 1900s and in the 1970s to 1980s with warm periods during the 1920s to 1960s and from the 1990s through to the present, similar to the variability in the {AMO} index where a positive (negative) {AMO} index represents warm (cold) periods. Sea-ice extent in the north has also varied at multidecadal scales with the ice retreating during the warm periods and expanding during the cold periods. The presence of multidecadal variability is also suggested from marine sediment paleo data as well as ice-core oxygen isotope data. Observations of biological impacts of the multidecadal variability in the northern regions include a general increase in plankton and fish productivity, as well as expansion of the species distributions northward, in conjunction with the {AMO} warm periods and the opposite during {AMO} cold periods. In addition, a review of the mechanisms responsible for the {AMO} and a brief discussion of the linkages between the multidecadal variability in the northern and southern hemispheres, including between the Arctic and Antarctic, are presented.},

	abstract = {Cellular Automata ({CA}) \& Markov-Chain modeling are concepts that are utilized in numerous branches of science. Powerful as they are independently, these two theoretical concepts can be of immense use when fused together and applied in practical situations. {CA} and Markov models have spread their wraths over geosciences and with the advancement of remote sensing and {GIS} technologies along with an exponential increase in computing and modeling power. Over the last few years, these concepts have found a solid ground for research in this domain of geospatial environmental modeling in earth sciences. It is widely used to characterize the dynamics of land use/cover, forest cover, urban sprawl, wetland landscape, plant growth and modeling of watershed management, suitable site selection, coastal zone management and so forth. This paper aims to categorize these researches into broad categories. This paper discusses the concepts of {CA}-Markov modeling and their backgrounds and is followed by a classification of the researches conducted in this domain into two broad groups, one being the development of concepts and the adopted methodologies, while the other discusses the application of these methods in solving and studying real world scenarios. Recent developments in this domain have been observed which uses concepts and technologies previously unused in conjunction to {CA}. However, several limitations like non-accountability of human influences, unavailability of high resolution imagery, primary discrepancy between the simulations of {CA} with {GIS}, human decision making were also addressed in details. At the same time numerous advancements like inclusion of fuzzy logic, possibility of textural classification, removing biases in simulation and developing a {CA}-based 2D and 3D land use simulation module are elaborated which are at present showing some promising avenues wherein significant research can be done in future.},

Piecewise linear regression is not always appropriate since the relationship may experiment sudden changes due to climatic, environmental, or anthropogenic perturbations. To address this issue, a practical and general approach to the Bayesian analysis of the multivariate regression model is presented. The approach allows simultaneous single change point detection in a multivariate sample and can account for missing data in the response variables and/or in the explicative variables. It also improves on recently published change point detection methodologies by allowing a more flexible and thus more realistic prior specification for the existence of a change and the date of change as well as for the regression parameters. The estimation of all unknown parameters is achieved by Monte Carlo Markov chain simulations. It is shown that the developed approach is able to reproduce the results of Rasmussen (2001) as well as those of Perreault et al. (2000a, 2000b). Furthermore, two of the examples provided in the paper show that the proposed methodology can readily be applied to some problems that cannot be addressed by any of the above-mentioned approaches because of limiting model structure and/or restrictive prior assumptions. The first of these examples deals with single change point detection in the multivariate linear relationship between mean basin-scale precipitation at different periods of the year and the summer–autumn flood peaks of the Broadback River located in northern Quebec, Canada. The second one addresses the problem of missing data estimation with uncertainty assessment in multisite streamflow records with a possible simultaneous shift in mean streamflow values that occurred at an unknown date.},

Non-stationary frequency models integrate trends and climate variability by introducing covariates in the distribution parameters. These models often assume that the distribution function and shape of the distribution do not change. However, these assumptions are rarely verified in practice. We propose here an approach based on L-moment ratio diagrams to analyze changes in the distribution function and shape parameter of hydro-climate extremes. We found that important changes occur in the distribution of annual maximum streamflow and extreme temperatures. Eventual relations between the shapes of the distributions of extremes and climate indices are also identified. We provide an example of a non-stationary frequency model applied to flood flows. Results show that a model with a shape parameter dependent on climate indices in combination with a scale parameter dependent on time improves significantly the goodness-of-fit.},

	abstract = {Understanding how climate extremes are sensitive to a changing climate requires characterization of the physical mechanisms behind such events. For this purpose, the application of self-organizing maps ({SOMs}) has become popular in the climate science literature. One potential drawback, though not unique to {SOMs}, is that the background synoptic conditions represented by {SOMs} may be too generalized to adequately describe the atypical conditions that can co-occur during the extreme event being considered. In this paper, using the Australian region as a case study, we illustrate how the commonly used {SOM} training procedure can be readily modified to produce both more accurate patterns and patterns that would otherwise occur too rarely to be represented in the {SOM}. Even with these improvements, we illustrate that without careful treatment, the synoptic conditions that co-occur during some types of extreme events (i.e., heavy rainfall and midlatitudinal cyclone occurrence days) risk being poorly represented by the {SOM} patterns. In contrast, we find that during Australian heat wave events the circulation is indeed well represented by the {SOM} patterns and that this application can provide additional insight to composite analysis. While these results should not necessarily discourage researchers seeking to apply {SOMs} to study climate extremes, they highlight the importance of first critically evaluating the features represented by the {SOM}. This study has provided a methodological framework for such an evaluation which is directly applicable to other weather typing procedures, regions, and types of extreme events.},

Under suitable conditions, exceedances over a high threshold have been shown to follow the generalized Pareto distribution ({GPD}) asymptotically. In practice, however, the threshold must be chosen. If the chosen threshold is too low, the {GPD} approximation may not hold and bias can occur. If the threshold is chosen too high, reduced sample size increases the variance of parameter estimates. To process batch analyses, commonly used selection methods such as graphical diagnostics are subjective and cannot be automated. We develop an efficient technique to evaluate and apply the Anderson–Darling test to the sample of exceedances above a fixed threshold. In order to automate threshold selection, this test is used in conjunction with a recently developed stopping rule that controls the false discovery rate in ordered hypothesis testing. Previous attempts in this setting do not account for the issue of ordered multiple testing. The performance of the method is assessed in a large scale simulation study that mimics practical return level estimation. This procedure was repeated at hundreds of sites in the western {US} to generate return level maps of extreme precipitation.},

	abstract = {Extreme Value Theory ({EVT}) is an important tool to predict efficient gains and losses. Its main areas of analyses are economic and environmental. Initially, for that form of event, it was developed the use of patterns of parametric distribution such as Normal and Gamma. However, economic and environmental data presents, in most cases, a heavy-tailed distribution, in contrast to those distributions. Thus, it was faced a great difficult to frame extreme events. Furthermore, it was almost impossible to use conventional models, making predictions about non-observed events, which exceed the maximum of observations. In some situations {EVT} is used to analyse only the maximum of some dataset, which provide few observations, and in those cases it is more effective to use the r largest-order statistics. This paper aims to propose Bayesian estimators' for parameters of the r largest-order statistics. During the research, it was used Monte Carlo simulation to analyze the data, and it was observed some properties of those estimators, such as mean, variance, bias and Root Mean Square Error ({RMSE}). The estimation of the parameters provided inference for its parameters and return levels. This paper also shows a procedure to the choice of the r-optimal to the r largest-order statistics, based on the Bayesian approach applying Markov chains Monte Carlo ({MCMC}). Simulation results reveal that the Bayesian approach has a similar performance to the Maximum Likelihood Estimation, and the applications were developed using the Bayesian approach and showed a gain in accurary compared with otherestimators.},

In practice, the choice of r is critical. If r is too large, bias can occur; if too small, the variance of the estimator can be high. The limiting distribution of the r largest order statistics, denoted by {GEV} \$\$\_r\$\$ r , extends that of the block maxima. Two specification tests are proposed to select r sequentially. The first is a score test for the {GEV} \$\$\_r\$\$ r distribution. Due to the special characteristics of the {GEV} \$\$\_r\$\$ r distribution, the classical chi-square asymptotics cannot be used. The simplest approach is to use the parametric bootstrap, which is straightforward to implement but computationally expensive. An alternative fast weighted bootstrap or multiplier procedure is developed for computational efficiency. The second test uses the difference in estimated entropy between the {GEV} \$\$\_r\$\$ r and {GEV} \$\$\_\{r-1\}\$\$ r - 1 models, applied to the r largest order statistics and the \$\$r-1\$\$ r - 1 largest order statistics, respectively. The asymptotic distribution of the difference statistic is derived. In a large scale simulation study, both tests held their size and had substantial power to detect various misspecification schemes. A new approach to address the issue of multiple, sequential hypotheses testing is adapted to this setting to control the false discovery rate or familywise error rate.

	abstract = {Flood frequency analyses are often based on recorded series at gauging stations. However, the length of the available data sets is usually too short to provide reliable estimates of extreme design floods. Hence, hydrologists have tried to make use of alternative sources of information to enrich the datasets used for the statistical inferences. Two main approaches were therefore proposed. The first consists in extending the information in time, making use of historical and paleoflood data. The second, spatial extension, consists in merging statistically homogeneous data to build large regional data samples. Recently, a combination of the two techniques aiming at including estimated extreme discharges at ungauged sites of a region in the regional flood frequency analyses has been proposed. This paper presents a consolidation of this approach and its comparison with the standard regional flood frequency approach proposed by Hosking \& Wallis. A modification of the likelihood function is introduced to enable the simultaneous calibration of a regional index flood relation and of the parameters of the regional growth curve. Moreover, the efficiency of the proposed method is evaluated based on a large number of Monte Carlo simulated data sets. This work confirms that extreme peak discharges estimated at ungauged sites may be of great value for the evaluation of large return period (typically over 100 years) flood quantiles. They should therefore not be neglected despite the uncertainties associated to these estimates.},

Most current risk assessment models rely on the assumption of stationarity (i.e., no temporal change in statistics of extremes). Most nonstationary modeling studies focus primarily on changes in extremes over time. Here, we present Process-informed Nonstationary Extreme Value Analysis ({ProNEVA}) as a generalized tool for incorporating different types of physical drivers (i.e., underlying processes), stationary and nonstationary concepts, and extreme value analysis methods (i.e., annual maxima, peak-over-threshold). {ProNEVA} builds upon a newly-developed hybrid evolution Markov Chain Monte Carlo ({MCMC}) approach for numerical parameters estimation and uncertainty assessment. This offers more robust uncertainty estimates of return periods of climatic extremes under both stationary and nonstationary assumptions. {ProNEVA} is designed as a generalized tool allowing using different types of data and nonstationarity concepts physically-based or purely statistical) into account. In this paper, we show a wide range of applications describing changes in: annual maxima river discharge in response to urbanization, annual maxima sea levels over time, annual maxima temperatures in response to {CO}2 emissions in the atmosphere, and precipitation with a peak-over-threshold approach. {ProNEVA} is freely available to the public and includes a user-friendly Graphical User Interface ({GUI}) to enhance its implementation.},

For a given sea state, the distribution of both hourly maximum crest and hourly maximum wave height, normalised by sea state significant wave height, is found to follow a generalised extreme value ({GEV}) distribution. Variation of the three parameters of the {GEV} distribution across sea states, is expressed in terms of a response surface model as a function of non-dimensional sea state Ursell number and wave steepness, and wave directional spreading angle. For inference, conventional Monte Carlo wave basin measurements are supplemented with measurements selected by means of a novel “pre-selection” sampling scheme using numerical simulations. This scheme effectively guarantees that extreme events from tails of distributions are produced, and reduces uncertainties associated with the estimated distributions. Estimation is performed using Bayesian inference, allowing uncertainties to be quantified, and providing estimates of posterior predictive tail distributions for sea states with arbitrary characteristics within the domain of sea state characteristics covered by the model.},

	abstract = {This paper proposes a detailed comparison of local and regional approaches for flood frequency analyses, with a special emphasis on the effects of (a) the information on extreme floods used in the analysis (historical data or recent extreme floods observed at ungauged sites), and (b) the assumptions associated with regional approaches (statistical homogeneity of considered series, independence of observations). The results presented are based on two case studies: the Ardèche and Argens rivers regions in south-east of France. Four approaches are compared: 1 – local analysis based on continuous measured series, 2 – local analysis with historical information, 3 – regional index-flood analysis based on continuous series, 4 – regional analysis involving information on extremes (including both historical floods and recent floods observed at ungauged sites). The inference approach used is based on a {GEV} distribution and a Bayesian Monte Carlo Markov Chain approach for parameters estimation. The comparison relies both on (1) available observed datasets and (2) Monte Carlo simulations in order to evaluate the effects of sampling variability and to analyze the possible influence of regional heterogeneities. The results indicate that a relatively limited level of regional heterogeneity, which may not be detected through homogeneity tests, may significantly affect the performances of regional approaches. These results also illustrate the added value of information on extreme floods, historical floods or recent floods observed at ungauged sites, in both local and regional approaches. As far as possible, gathering such information and incorporating it into flood frequency studies should be promoted. Finally, the presented Monte Carlo simulations appear as an interesting analysis tool for adapting the estimation strategy to the available data for each specific case study.},

Our motivation is that the quantiles of hydrological process depend on scale parameter as well as location parameter in the {GEV} distribution. The proposed model extends the nonstationary Bayesian model with jumping location parameters on the time domain, and it provides a wider class of models to explain abrupt location changes and smooth dispersion changes simultaneously as well as separately in the hydrological processes. This study also suggests the use of the Bayesian model selection procedure by logarithm of the pseudo marginal likelihood ({LPML}).

	abstract = {As a warming climate leads to more frequent heavy rainfall, the importance of accurate rainfall statistics is increasing. Rainfall statistics are often presented as intensity-duration-frequency ({IDF}) curves showing the rainfall intensity (return level) that can be expected at a location for a duration, and the frequency of this intensity (return period). {IDF} curves are commonly constructed by fitting generalized extreme value ({GEV}) distributions to observed annual maximum rainfall for several target durations. As the estimation is performed independently across durations, the resulting {IDF} curves may be inconsistent across durations and return periods. This paper proposes to ensure consistency by post-processing the estimated {IDF} curves. Two post-processing approaches are considered, a quantile selection algorithm that searches for consistent return levels within the posterior quantiles of a Bayesian inference approach, and adjustments based on isotonic regression. The methods are evaluated for simulated data and for Norwegian rainfall data from 83 locations, for hourly and sub-hourly durations. The post-processing yields consistent estimates that are at least as accurate as the unadjusted, inconsistent estimates. We also demonstrate how our approach differs from d-{GEV}, a method that performs simultaneous estimation across durations. An R implementation for the post-processing methods is available at https://github.com/{ClimDesign}/{fixIDF}.},

	abstract = {In this study, a 91-year data set at the Wusong Station near Shanghai City in Yangtze Estuary has been used to estimate the 100-year Annual Maximum Water Level ({AMWL}). The performances of four common distribution models have been evaluated. The {GEV} model provides the best estimates of an {AMWL}. It results in the minimum difference (0.04m) compared to the observed 92-year {AMWL}, with the high correlation coefficient (0.99) and minimum root-mean-square-error (0.045m) value. Predictions from other distribution models cause non-negligible deviations, underestimating the 92-year {AMWL} by 0.57, 0.38, and 0.15m for Weibell, Lognormal, and Gumbel distribution models, respectively. In order to examine the effects of a shorter data set, a 59-year data set was investigated. Model predictions using 59-year data set underestimates the observed 60-year {AMWLs}. By comparing to the 100-year {AMWL} estimated by the {GEV} distribution, using the 91-year data set, results using the shorter 59-year data set lead to underestimates of the 100-year {AMWL} by 0.78m for Weibull, 0.58m for Lognormal, 0.38m for Gumbel, and 0.39m for {GEV} distributions. Therefore, one should be cautious when estimating the 100-year {AMWL} if the data set covers a period much shorter than 100 years. Selecting an appropriate distribution model can improve prediction accuracy.},

	abstract = {We present a semi-Bayesian hierarchical modeling framework for conducting space–time frequency analysis of precipitation extremes over a large domain. In this framework, the data layer, the precipitation extreme – i.e., seasonal maximum precipitation, at each station in each year is modeled using a generalized extreme value ({GEV}) distribution with temporally varying parameters, which are decomposed as linear functions of covariates. The coefficients of the covariates are estimated via maximum likelihood ({ML}). In the process layer, the estimated {ML} coefficients of each of the covariates across the stations are spatially modeled with a Gaussian multivariate process which enables capturing the spatial structure and correlation between the spatial model parameters. Suitable priors are used for the spatial model hyperparameters to complete the Bayesian formulation. Since the Bayesian formulation is only at the second level, our model is semi-Bayesian and thus, the posteriors are conditional posterior distributions. With the conditional posterior distribution of spatial fields of the {GEV} parameters for each time, conditional posterior distribution of the nonstationary space–time return levels of the precipitation extremes are obtained. We demonstrate this framework by application to summer precipitation extreme at 73 stations covering a large domain of Southwest {US} consisting of Arizona, New Mexico, Colorado, and Utah. The results from fitting and cross-validation indicate that our model captures the historical variability at the stations very well. Conditional posterior distributions of return levels are simulated on a grid over the domain, which will be of immense utility in management of natural resources and infrastructure.},

Recently, vine copulas have been introduced, allowing multi-dimensional dependence structures to be described on the basis of a stage by stage mixing of 2-dimensional copulas. This paper explores the use of such vine copulas in order to incorporate all relevant dependences between the storm variables of interest. On the basis of such fitted vine copulas, an external storm structure is modelled. An internal storm structure is superimposed based on Huff curves, such that a continuous time series of rainfall is generated. The performance of the rainfall model is evaluated through a statistical comparison between an ensemble of synthetical rainfall series and the observed rainfall series and through the comparison of the annual maxima.},

This bivariate nonstationary distribution is modeled using a threshold-based approach for the margins of S and {HS} and a dynamic copula for their dependence structure. Among the covariates considered, atmospheric pressure and related wind speed are primary forcings for the margins of S and {HS}, but temperature is the main positive forcing of their dependence.

resource planning and management. This study proposes a multiple-dependence condition model via vine copulas for the purpose of estimating streamflow at partially gaged sites. The proposed model is attractive in modeling the high-dimensional joint distribution by building a hierarchy of conditional bivariate copulas when provided a complex streamflow gage network. The usefulness of the proposed model is firstly highlighted using a synthetic streamflow scenario. In this analysis, the bivariate copula model and a variant of the vine copulas are also employed to show the ability of the multiple-dependence structure adopted in the proposed model. Furthermore, the evaluations are extended to a case study of 54 gages located within the Yadkin–Pee Dee River basin in the eastern {USA}. Both results inform that the proposed model is better suited for infilling missing values. To be specific, the proposed multiple-dependence model shows the improvement of 9.2 \% on average compared to the bivariate model from the historical case study. The performance of the vine copula is further compared with six other infilling approaches to confirm its applicability. Results demonstrate that the proposed model produces more reliable streamflow estimates than the other approaches. In particular, when applied to partially gaged sites with sufficient available data, the proposed model clearly outperforms the other models. Even though the model is illustrated by a specific case, it can be extended to other regions with diverse hydro-climatological variables for the objective of infilling.},

	abstract = {Abstract. Stochastic weather simulation models are commonly employed in water
resources management, agricultural applications, forest management,
transportation management, and recreational activities. Stochastic
simulation of multisite precipitation occurrence is a challenge because of
its intermittent characteristics as well as spatial and temporal
cross-correlation. This study proposes a novel simulation method for
multisite precipitation occurrence employing a nonparametric technique, the
discrete version of the k-nearest neighbor resampling ({KNNR}), and couples
it with a genetic algorithm ({GA}). Its modification for the study of climatic
change adaptation is also tested. The datasets simulated from both the discrete {KNNR}
({DKNNR}) model and an existing traditional model were evaluated using a number of
statistics, such as occurrence and transition probabilities, as well as
temporal and spatial cross-correlations. Results showed that the proposed
{DKNNR} model with {GA}-simulated multisite precipitation occurrence preserved
the lagged cross-correlation between sites, while the existing conventional
model was not able to reproduce lagged cross-correlation between stations, so
long stochastic simulation was required. Also, the {GA} mixing process
provided a number of new patterns that were different from observations,
which was not feasible with the sole {DKNNR} model. When climate change was
considered, the model performed satisfactorily, but further improvement is
required to more accurately simulate specific variations of the occurrence
probability.},

	abstract = {We propose a new Monte Carlo method for sampling from multimodal distributions. The idea of this technique is based on splitting the task into two: finding the modes of a target distribution \$π\$ and sampling, given the knowledge of the locations of the modes. The sampling algorithm relies on steps of two types: local ones, preserving the mode; and jumps to regions associated with different modes. Besides, the method learns the optimal parameters of the algorithm while it runs, without requiring user intervention. Our technique should be considered as a flexible framework, in which the design of moves can follow various strategies known from the broad {MCMC} literature. In order to design an adaptive scheme that facilitates both local and jump moves, we introduce an auxiliary variable representing each mode and we define a new target distribution \${\textbackslash}tildeπ\$ on an augmented state space \${\textbackslash}mathcal\{X\}{\textasciitilde}{\textbackslash}times{\textasciitilde}{\textbackslash}mathcal\{I\}\$, where \${\textbackslash}mathcal\{X\}\$ is the original state space of \$π\$ and \${\textbackslash}mathcal\{I\}\$ is the set of the modes. As the algorithm runs and updates its parameters, the target distribution \${\textbackslash}tildeπ\$ also keeps being modified. This motivates a new class of algorithms, Auxiliary Variable Adaptive {MCMC}. We prove general ergodic results for the whole class before specialising to the case of our algorithm.},

Rubin's combination formula requires that the imputation method is \&quot;proper\&quot; which essentially means that the imputations are random draws from a posterior distribution in a Bayesian framework. In national statistical institutes ({NSI}'s) like Statistics Norway, the methods used for imputing for nonresponse are typically non-Bayesian, e.g., some kind of stratified hot-deck. Hence, Rubin's method of multiple imputation is not valid and cannot be applied in {NSI}'s. This paper deals with the problem of deriving an alternative combination formula that can be applied for imputation methods typically used in {NSI}'s and suggests an approach for studying this problem. Alternative combination formulas are derived for certain response mechanisms and hot-deck type imputation methods.},

	abstract = {Abstract. Projections of coastal storm surge hazard are a basic requirement for
effective management of coastal risks. A common approach for estimating
hazards posed by extreme sea levels is to use a statistical model, which may
use a time series of a climate variable
as a covariate to modulate the statistical model and account for potentially
nonstationary storm surge behavior (e.g., North Atlantic Oscillation index).
Previous works using nonstationary statistical approaches to assess coastal
flood hazard have demonstrated the importance of accounting for many key
modeling uncertainties. However, many assessments have typically relied on a
single climate covariate, which may leave out important processes and lead to
potential biases in the projected flood hazards. Here, I employ a recently
developed approach to integrate stationary and nonstationary statistical
models, and characterize the effects of choice of covariate time series on
projected flood hazard. Furthermore, I expand upon this approach by
developing a nonstationary storm surge statistical model that makes use of
multiple covariate time series, namely, global mean temperature, sea level,
the North Atlantic Oscillation index and time. Using Norfolk, Virginia, as a
case study, I show that a storm surge model that accounts for additional
processes raises the projected 100-year storm surge return level by up to
23 cm relative to a stationary model or one that employs a single covariate
time series. I find that the total model posterior probability associated
with each candidate covariate, as well as a stationary model, is about
20 \%. These results shed light on how including a wider range of physical
process information and considering nonstationary behavior can better enable
modeling efforts to inform coastal risk management.},

	abstract = {Abstract. A traditional metric used in hydrology to summarize model
performance is the Nash–Sutcliffe efficiency ({NSE}). Increasingly an
alternative metric, the Kling–Gupta efficiency ({KGE}), is used instead. When
{NSE} is used, {NSE} = 0 corresponds to using the mean flow as a benchmark
predictor. The same reasoning is applied in various studies that use {KGE} as
a metric: negative {KGE} values are viewed as bad model performance, and only
positive values are seen as good model performance. Here we show that using
the mean flow as a predictor does not result in {KGE} = 0, but instead {KGE} =1-√2≈-0.41. Thus, {KGE} values greater than −0.41
indicate that a model improves upon the mean flow benchmark – even if the
model's {KGE} value is negative. {NSE} and {KGE} values cannot be directly
compared, because their relationship is non-unique and depends in part on
the coefficient of variation of the observed time series. Therefore,
modellers who use the {KGE} metric should not let their understanding of {NSE}
values guide them in interpreting {KGE} values and instead develop new
understanding based on the constitutive parts of the {KGE} metric and the
explicit use of benchmark values to compare {KGE} scores against. More
generally, a strong case can be made for moving away from ad hoc use of
aggregated efficiency metrics and towards a framework based on
purpose-dependent evaluation metrics and benchmarks that allows for more
robust model adequacy assessment.},

Copula-based dependence modelling is a popular tool in conditional risk assessment, but is usually applied to pairs of variables. By contrast, Vine copulas provide greater flexibility and permit the modelling of complex dependency patterns using a wide variety of bivariate copulas which may be arranged and analysed in a tree structure to explore multiple dependencies. This study emphasises the use of R-vine copulas in an analysis of the co-dependencies of five reservoirs in the cascade of the Saint-John River basin in Eastern Canada. The developed R-vine copulas lead to the joint and conditional return periods of maximum volumes, for hydrologic design and cascade reservoir management in the basin. The main attraction of this approach to risk modelling is the flexibility in the choice of distributions used to model heavy-tailed marginals and co-dependencies.},

However, accurate analysis and simulation of the joint distribution of rainfall and temperature are difficult due to possible interdependence between them. As one possible approach to this problem, five families of copula models are employed to model the interdependence between rainfall and temperature. Scania is a leading agricultural province in Sweden and is affected by a maritime climate. Historical climatic data for Scania is used to demonstrate the modeling process. Heteroscedasticity and autocorrelation of sample data are also considered to eliminate the possibility of observation error. The results indicate that for Scania there are negative correlations between rainfall and temperature for the months from April to July and September. The student copula is found to be most suitable to model the bivariate distribution of rainfall and temperature based on the Akaike information criterion ({AIC}) and Bayesian information criterion ({BIC}). Using the student copula, we simulate temperature and rainfall simultaneously. The resulting models can be integrated with research on agricultural production and planning to study the effects of changing climate on crop yields.},

	abstract = {Abstract 
            In flood frequency analysis ({FFA}), annual maximum ({AM}) model is widely adopted in practice due to its straightforward sampling process. However, {AM} model has been criticized for its limited flexibility. {FFA} using peaks-over-threshold ({POT}) model is an alternative to {AM} model, which offers several theoretical advantages; however, this model is currently underemployed internationally. This study aims to bridge the current knowledge gap by conducting a scoping review covering several aspects of the {POT} approach including model assumptions, independence criteria, threshold selection, parameter estimation, probability distribution, regionalization and stationarity. We have reviewed the previously published articles on {POT} model to investigate: (a) possible reasons for underemployment of the {POT} model in {FFA}; and (b) challenges in applying the {POT} model. It is highlighted that the {POT} model offers a greater flexibility compared to the {AM} model due to the nature of sampling process associated with the {POT} model. The {POT} is more capable of providing less biased flood estimates for frequent floods. The underemployment of {POT} model in {FFA} is mainly due to the complexity in selecting a threshold (e.g., physical threshold to satisfy independence criteria and statistical threshold for Generalized Pareto distribution – the most commonly applied distribution in {POT} modelling). It is also found that the uncertainty due to individual variable and combined effects of the variables are not well assessed in previous research, and there is a lack of established guideline to apply {POT} model in {FFA}.},

	abstract = {Extreme sea levels are a significant threat to life, property, and the environment. These threats are managed by coastal planers through the implementation of risk mitigation strategies. Central to such strategies is knowledge of extreme event probabilities. Typically, these probabilities are estimated by fitting a suitable distribution to the observed extreme data. Estimates, however, are often uncertain due to the small number of extreme events in the tide gauge record and are only available at gauged locations. This restricts our ability to implement cost-effective mitigation. A remarkable fact about sea-level extremes is the existence of spatial dependences, yet the vast majority of studies to date have analyzed extremes on a site-by-site basis. Here we demonstrate that spatial dependences can be exploited to address the limitations posed by the spatiotemporal sparseness of the observational record. We achieve this by pooling all of the tide gauge data together through a Bayesian hierarchical model that describes how the distribution of surge extremes varies in time and space. Our approach has two highly desirable advantages: 1) it enables sharing of information across data sites, with a consequent drastic reduction in estimation uncertainty; 2) it permits interpolation of both the extreme values and the extreme distribution parameters at any arbitrary ungauged location. Using our model, we produce an observation-based probabilistic reanalysis of surge extremes covering the entire Atlantic and North Sea coasts of Europe for the period 1960–2013.},

	abstract = {Abstract. In Canada, risk of flooding due to heavy rainfall has risen in recent decades; the most notable recent examples include the July 2013 storm in the Greater Toronto region and the May 2017 flood of the Toronto Islands. We investigate nonstationarity and trends in the short-duration precipitation extremes in selected urbanized locations in Southern Ontario, Canada, and evaluate the potential of nonstationary intensity–duration–frequency ({IDF}) curves, which form an input to civil infrastructural design. Despite apparent signals of nonstationarity in precipitation extremes in all locations, the stationary vs. nonstationary models do not exhibit any significant differences in the design storm intensity, especially for short recurrence intervals (up to 10 years). The signatures of nonstationarity in rainfall extremes do not necessarily imply the use of nonstationary {IDFs} for design considerations. When comparing the proposed {IDFs} with current design standards, for return periods (10 years or less) typical for urban drainage design, current design standards require an update of up to 7 \%, whereas for longer recurrence intervals (50–100 years), ideal for critical civil infrastructural design, updates ranging between  ∼ 2 and 44 \% are suggested. We further emphasize that the above findings need re-evaluation in the light of climate change projections since the intensity and frequency of extreme precipitation are expected to intensify due to global warming.},

In our study, we aimed to estimate the impact on the performance of the return levels resulting from an {IDF} model that accounts for such asymptotical dependence. To investigate this impact, we compared the performance of the return level estimates of two {IDF} models using the quantile skill index ({QSI}). One {IDF} model is based on a max-stable process assuming asymptotic dependence; the other is a simplified (or reduced) duration-dependent {GEV} model assuming asymptotic independence. The resulting {QSI} shows that the overall performance of the two models is very similar, with the max-stable model slightly outperforming the other model for short durations (d≤10h). From a simulation study, we conclude that max-stable processes are worth considering for {IDF} curve estimation when focusing on short durations if the model’s asymptotic dependence can be assumed to be properly captured.},

	abstract = {In this article, we investigate the dependence of extreme surges on the North Atlantic weather regime variability across different timescales using the North Atlantic Oscillation ({NAO}) and Scandinavian blocking ({SCAND}) indices. The analysis was done using time series of surges along the North French Coast, covering long time periods (43 to 172 years of data). Time series that exhibited gaps were filled using linear interpolation to allow spectral analyses to be conducted. First, a continuous wavelet analysis on monthly maxima surges in the North French Coast was conducted to identify the multi-timescale variability. Second, a wavelet coherence analysis and maximum overlap discrete wavelet transform ({MODWT}) were used to study the timescale-dependent relationships between maxima surges and {NAO} or {SCAND}. Finally, {NAO} and {SCAND} were tested as physical covariates for a nonstationary generalized extreme value ({GEV}) distribution to fit monthly maxima surge series. Specific low-frequency variabilities characterizing these indices (extracted using {MODWT}) were also used as covariates to determine whether such specific variabilities would allow for even better {GEV} fitting. The results reveal common multi-annual timescales of variability between monthly maxima surge time series along the North French coasts: {\textasciitilde}2–3 years, {\textasciitilde}5–7 years, and {\textasciitilde}12–17 years. These modes of variability were found to be mainly induced by the {NAO} and the {SCAND}. We identified a greater influence of the {NAO} on the monthly maxima surges of the westernmost stations (Brest, Cherbourg, Le Havre), while the {SCAND} showed a greater influence on the northernmost station (Dunkirk). This shows that the physical climate effects at multi-annual scales are manifested differently between the Atlantic/English Channel and the North Sea regions influenced by {NAO} and {SCAND}, respectively. Finally, the introduction of these two climate indices was found to clearly enhance {GEV} models as well as a few timescales of these indices.},

	abstract = {A new Ensemble Empirical Mode Decomposition ({EEMD}) is presented. This new approach consists of sifting an ensemble of white noise-added signal (data) and treats the mean as the final true result. Finite, not infinitesimal, amplitude white noise is necessary to force the ensemble to exhaust all possible solutions in the sifting process, thus making the different scale signals to collate in the proper intrinsic mode functions ({IMF}) dictated by the dyadic filter banks. As {EEMD} is a time–space analysis method, the added white noise is averaged out with sufficient number of trials; the only persistent part that survives the averaging process is the component of the signal (original data), which is then treated as the true and more physical meaningful answer. The effect of the added white noise is to provide a uniform reference frame in the time–frequency space; therefore, the added noise collates the portion of the signal of comparable scale in one {IMF}. With this ensemble mean, one can separate scales naturally without any a priori subjective criterion selection as in the intermittence test for the original {EMD} algorithm. This new approach utilizes the full advantage of the statistical characteristics of white noise to perturb the signal in its true solution neighborhood, and to cancel itself out after serving its purpose; therefore, it represents a substantial improvement over the original {EMD} and is a truly noise-assisted data analysis ({NADA}) method.},

            For several decades the existence of interdecadal and multidecadal internal climate oscillations has been asserted by numerous studies based on analyses of historical observations, paleoclimatic data and climate model simulations. Here we use a combination of observational data and state-of-the-art forced and control climate model simulations to demonstrate the absence of consistent evidence for decadal or longer-term internal oscillatory signals that are distinguishable from climatic noise. Only variability in the interannual range associated with the El Niño/Southern Oscillation is found to be distinguishable from the noise background. A distinct (40–50 year timescale) spectral peak that appears in global surface temperature observations appears to reflect the response of the climate system to both anthropogenic and natural forcing rather than any intrinsic internal oscillation. These findings have implications both for the validity of previous studies attributing certain long-term climate trends to internal low-frequency climate cycles and for the prospect of decadal climate predictability.},

            Understanding long-term, ocean wave climate variability is important to assess climate change impacts on coastal and ocean physics and engineering. Teleconnection patterns can represent wave climate variability in the context of climate change. The objective of this study is to identify how large-scale spatial distributions of wave heights vary on a monthly basis and how they are influenced by various teleconnection patterns using reanalysis datasets. The wave height climate responses to teleconnection patterns in the eastern part of the North Pacific and North Atlantic are more sensible than in the corresponding western parts. The dominant spatial patterns of monthly averaged wave height variability in winter were obtained by empirical orthogonal function analysis. The three dominant patterns in the North Pacific and North Atlantic are similar. It is remarkable that one of the three dominant patterns, a band-shaped pattern, exhibits a strong relation to the teleconnection pattern in each ocean. The band-shaped pattern for the North Pacific was investigated in detail and found to be related to the west Pacific ({WP}) pattern. Where and how each teleconnection pattern influences wave climate becomes apparent especially during winter.},

The model takes into account the dependence between the magnitude and occurrence time of exceedances and allows for closed-form inference on tail probabilities and large quantiles. It is used to analyze daily water levels from the Rivière des Mille Îles (Québec, Canada) and to characterize drought patterns in the Montréal area. The model is useful to generate short-term probability forecasts and to estimate the return period of major droughts. This information on the drought events is critical to water resource professionals in planning, designing, building, and managing more efficient water resource systems to hedge against the water shortage in case of extreme droughts.},

	abstract = {Abstract 
            Current global riverine flood risk studies assume a constant mean sea level boundary. In reality high sea levels can propagate up a river, impede high river discharge, thus leading to elevated water levels. Riverine flood risk in deltas may therefore be underestimated. This paper presents the first global scale assessment of the joint influence of riverine and coastal drivers of flooding in deltas. We show that if storm surge is ignored, flood depths are significantly underestimated for 9.3\% of the expected annual population exposed to riverine flooding. The assessment is based on extreme water levels at 3433 river mouth locations as modeled by a state-of-the-art global river routing model, forced with a multi-model runoff ensemble and bounded by dynamic sea level conditions derived from a global tide and surge reanalysis. We first classified the drivers of riverine flooding at each location into four classes: surge-dominant, discharge-dominant, compound-dominant or insignificant. We then developed a model experiment to quantify the effect of surge on flood hazard and impacts. Drivers of riverine flooding are compound-dominant at 19.7\% of the locations analyzed, discharge-dominant at 69.2\%, and surge-dominant at 7.8\%. Compared to locations with either surge- or discharge-dominant flood drivers, locations with compound-dominant flood drivers generally have larger surge extremes and are located in basins with faster discharge response and/or flat topography. Globally, surge exacerbates 1-in-10 years flood levels at 64.0\% of the locations analyzed, with a mean increase of 11 cm. While this increase is generally larger at locations with compound- or surge-dominant flood drivers, flood levels also increase at locations with discharge-dominant flood drivers. This study underlines the importance of including dynamic downstream sea level boundaries in (global) riverine flood risk studies.},

In this article, we review the major developments and climatological applications of {SOMs} in the literature. The {SOM} can be used in synoptic climatological analysis in a manner similar to most other clustering methods. However, as the results from a {SOM} are generally represented by a two-dimensional array of cluster types that ‘self-organize’, the synoptic categories in the array effectively represent a continuum of synoptic categorizations, compared with discrete realizations produced through most traditional methods. Thus, a larger number of patterns can be more readily understood, and patterns, as well as transitional nodes between patterns, can be discerned. Perhaps the most intriguing development with {SOMs} has been the new avenues of visualization; the resultant spatial patterns of any variable can be more readily understood when displayed in a {SOM}. This improved visualization has led to {SOMs} becoming an increasingly popular tool in various research with climatological applications from other disciplines as well.},

Extreme value considerations are used to derive two further new copulas: the t extreme value copula is the limiting copula of componentwise maxima of t distributed random vectors; the t lower tail copula is the limiting copula of bivariate observations from a t distribution that are conditioned to lie below some joint threshold that is progressively lowered.

              Near-surface (10 m) wind speed ({NWS}) plays a crucial role in many areas, including hydrological cycles, wind energy production, and air pollution, but what drives its multidecadal changes is still unclear. Using reanalysis datasets and model simulations from phase 6 of the Coupled Model Intercomparison Projection ({CMIP}6), this study investigates recent trends in the annual mean {NWS}. The results show that the Northern Hemisphere ({NH}) terrestrial {NWS} experienced significant ( 
              p 
              {\textless} 0.1) decreasing trends during 1980–2010, when the Southern Hemisphere ({SH}) ocean {NWS} was characterized by significant ( 
              p 
              {\textless} 0.1) upward trends. However, during 2010–19, global {NWS} trends shifted in their sign: {NWS} trends over the {NH} land became positive, and trends over the {SH} tended to be negative. We propose that the strengthening of {SH} {NWS} during 1980–2010 was associated with an intensified Hadley cell over the {SH}, while the declining of {NH} land {NWS} could have been caused by changes in atmospheric circulation, alteration of vegetation and/or land use, and the accelerating Arctic warming. The {CMIP}6 model simulations further demonstrate that the greenhouse gas ({GHG}) warming plays an important role in triggering the {NWS} trends over the two hemispheres during 1980–2010 through modulating meridional atmospheric circulation. This study also points at the importance of anthropogenic {GHG} forcing and the natural Pacific decadal oscillation to the long-term trends and multidecadal variability in global {NWS}, respectively.},

	abstract = {In this paper an algorithm based on the ensemble empirical mode decomposition ({EEMD}) is presented. The key idea on the {EEMD} relies on averaging the modes obtained by {EMD} applied to several realizations of Gaussian white noise added to the original signal. The resulting decomposition solves the {EMD} mode mixing problem, however it introduces new ones. In the method here proposed, a particular noise is added at each stage of the decomposition and a unique residue is computed to obtain each mode. The resulting decomposition is complete, with a numerically negligible error. Two examples are presented: a discrete Dirac delta function and an electrocardiogram signal. The results show that, compared with {EEMD}, the new method here presented also provides a better spectral separation of the modes and a lesser number of sifting iterations is needed, reducing the computational cost.},

	abstract = {Significance 
            Population and assets in coastal regions are threatened by both oceanic and fluvial flooding hazards. Common flood hazard assessment practices typically focus on one flood driver at a time and ignore potential compounding impacts. Here we outline a unique bivariate flood hazard assessment framework that accounts for the interactions between a primary oceanic flooding hazard, coastal water level, and fluvial flooding hazards. Using the notion of “failure probability,” we also assess coastal flood hazard under different future sea level rise scenarios. The results show that, in a warming climate, future sea level rise not only increases the failure probability, but also exacerbates the compounding effects of flood drivers. 
          ,  
            Sea level rise ({SLR}), a well-documented and urgent aspect of anthropogenic global warming, threatens population and assets located in low-lying coastal regions all around the world. Common flood hazard assessment practices typically account for one driver at a time (e.g., either fluvial flooding only or ocean flooding only), whereas coastal cities vulnerable to {SLR} are at risk for flooding from multiple drivers (e.g., extreme coastal high tide, storm surge, and river flow). Here, we propose a bivariate flood hazard assessment approach that accounts for compound flooding from river flow and coastal water level, and we show that a univariate approach may not appropriately characterize the flood hazard if there are compounding effects. Using copulas and bivariate dependence analysis, we also quantify the increases in failure probabilities for 2030 and 2050 caused by {SLR} under representative concentration pathways 4.5 and 8.5. Additionally, the increase in failure probability is shown to be strongly affected by compounding effects. The proposed failure probability method offers an innovative tool for assessing compounding flood hazards in a warming climate.},

	abstract = {Abstract. Surface observations are usually too few and far between to properly assess multidecadal variations at the local scale and characterize historical local extreme events at the same time. A data assimilation scheme has been recently presented to assimilate daily observations of temperature and precipitation into downscaled reconstructions from a global extended reanalysis through an Ensemble Kalman fitting approach and to derive high-resolution fields. Recent studies also showed that assimilating observations at high temporal resolution does not guarantee correct multidecadal variations. The current paper thus proposes (1) to apply the data assimilation scheme over France and over the 1871–2012 period based on the {SCOPE} Climate reconstructions background dataset and all available daily historical surface observations of temperature and precipitation, (2) to develop an assimilation scheme at the yearly timescale and to apply it over the same period and lastly, (3) to derive the {FYRE} Climate reanalysis, a 25-member ensemble hybrid dataset resulting from the daily and yearly assimilation schemes, spanning the whole 1871–2012 period at a daily and 8 km resolution over France. Assimilating daily observations only allows reconstructing accurately daily characteristics, but fails in reproducing robust multidecadal variations when compared to independent datasets. Combining the daily and yearly assimilation schemes, {FYRE} Climate clearly performs better than the {SCOPE} Climate background in terms of bias, error, and correlation, but also better than the Safran reference surface reanalysis over France available from 1958 onward only. {FYRE} Climate also succeeds in reconstructing both local extreme events and multidecadal variability.

	shorttitle = {Spatiotemporal and cross-scale interactions in hydroclimate variability},
	abstract = {Abstract. Understanding how water resources vary in response to climate at different temporal and spatial scales is crucial to inform long-term management. Climate change impacts and induced trends may indeed be substantially modulated by low-frequency (multi-year) variations, whose strength varies in time and space, with large consequences for risk forecasting systems. In this study, we present a spatial classification of precipitation, temperature, and discharge variability in France, based on a fuzzy clustering and wavelet spectra of 152 near-natural watersheds between 1958 and 2008. We also explore phase–phase and phase–amplitude causal interactions between timescales of each homogeneous region. A total of three significant timescales of variability are found in precipitation, temperature, and discharge, i.e., 1, 2–4, and 5–8 years. The magnitude of these timescales of variability is, however, not constant over the different regions. For instance, southern regions are markedly different from other regions, with much lower (5–8 years) variability and much larger (2–4 years) variability. Several temporal changes in precipitation, temperature, and discharge variability are identified during the 1980s and 1990s. Notably, in the southern regions of France, we note a decrease in annual temperature variability in the mid 1990s. Investigating cross-scale interactions, our study reveals causal and bi-directional relationships between higher- and lower-frequency variability, which may feature interactions within the coupled land–ocean–atmosphere systems. Interestingly, however, even though time frequency patterns (occurrence and timing of timescales of variability) were similar between regions, cross-scale interactions are far much complex, differ between regions, and are not systematically transferred from climate (precipitation and temperature) to hydrological variability (discharge). Phase–amplitude interactions are indeed absent in discharge variability, although significant phase–amplitude interactions are found in precipitation and temperature. This suggests that watershed characteristics cancel the negative feedback systems found in precipitation and temperature. This study allows for a multi-timescale representation of hydroclimate variability in France and provides unique insight into the complex nonlinear dynamics of this variability and its predictability.},

	abstract = {Abstract. In coastal regions, floods can arise through a combination of multiple drivers, including direct surface run- off, river discharge, storm surge and waves. In this study, we analyse compound flood potential in Europe caused by these four main flooding sources using state-of-the-art databases with homogenous forcing (i.e., {ERA}5). First, we perform an analysis to assess the sensitivity of the compound flooding potential to several factors: 1) sampling method; 2) time window to select the concurrent event of the conditioned driver; 3) dependence metrics; 4) wave-driven sea level definition. We observe higher correlation coefficients using annual maxima than peaks over threshold. Regarding the other factors, our results show similar spatial distributions of the compound flooding potential. Second, the dependence between the pairs of drivers using the Kendall's rank correlation coefficient and the joint occurrence are synthesized for coherent patterns of compound flooding potential using a clustering technique. This quantitative multi-driver assessment not only distinguishes where overall compound flooding potential is the highest, but also discriminates which driver combinations are more likely to contribute to compound flooding. We identify hotspots of compound flooding potential located along the southern coast of the North Atlantic Ocean and the northern coast of the Mediterranean Sea.},

	abstract = {Many statistical methods involve summarizing a probability distribution by a region of the sample space covering a specified probability. One method of selecting such a region is to require it to contain points of relatively high density. Highest density regions are particularly useful for displaying multimodal distributions and, in such cases, may consist of several disjoint subsets-one for each local mode. In this paper, I propose a simple method for computing a highest density region from any given (possibly multivariate) density f(x) that is bounded and continuous in x. Several examples of the use of highest density regions in statistical graphics are also given. A new form of boxplot is proposed based on highest density regions; versions in one and two dimensions are given. Highest density regions in higher dimensions are also discussed and plotted.},

	abstract = {Abstract. In recent years, copula multivariate functions were used to model, probabilistically, the most important variables of flood events: discharge peak, flood volume and duration. However, in most of the cases, the sampling uncertainty, from which small-sized samples suffer, is neglected. In this paper, considering a real reservoir controlled by a dam as a case study, we apply a structure-based approach to estimate the probability of reaching specific reservoir levels, taking into account the key components of an event (flood peak, volume, hydrograph shape) and of the reservoir (rating curve, volume–water depth relation). Additionally, we improve information about the peaks from historical data and reports through a Bayesian framework, allowing the incorporation of supplementary knowledge from different sources and its associated error. As it is seen here, the extra information can result in a very different inferred parameter set and consequently this is reflected as a strong variability of the reservoir level, associated with a given return period. Most importantly, the sampling uncertainty is accounted for in both cases (single-site and multi-site with historical information scenarios), and Monte Carlo confidence intervals for the maximum water level are calculated. It is shown that water levels of specific return periods in a lot of cases overlap, thus making risk assessment, without providing confidence intervals, deceiving.},

Temperature extremes are also influenced by global-scale modes of climate variability. Temperature-Duration-Frequency ({TDF}) curves, which relate the intensity of heat events of different durations to their frequencies, can be useful tools for the analysis of heat extremes. To account for climate external forcings, we develop a nonstationary approach to the {TDF} curves by introducing indices that account for the temporal trend and teleconnections. Nonstationary {TDF} modeling can find applications in adaptive management in the fields of health care, public safety and energy production. We present a one-step method, based on the maximization of the composite likelihood of observed heat extremes, to build the nonstationary {TDF} curves. We show the importance of integrating the information concerning climate change and climate oscillations. In an application to the province of Quebec, Canada, the influence of Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillations ({AMO}) on heat events is shown to be more important than the temporal trend.},

	abstract = {Abstract. The erosion of a beach depends on various storm characteristics. Ideally, the risk associated with a storm would be described by a single multivariate return period that is also representative of the erosion risk, i.e. a 100 yr multivariate storm return period would cause a 100 yr erosion return period. Unfortunately, a specific probability level may be associated with numerous combinations of storm characteristics. These combinations, despite having the same multivariate probability, may cause very different erosion outcomes. This paper explores this ambiguity problem in the context of copula based multivariate return periods and using a case study at Durban on the east coast of South Africa. Simulations were used to correlate multivariate return periods of historical events to return periods of estimated storm induced erosion volumes. In addition, the relationship of the most-likely design event (Salvadori et al., 2011) to coastal erosion was investigated. It was found that the multivariate return periods for wave height and duration had the highest correlation to erosion return periods. The most-likely design event was found to be an inadequate design method in its current form. We explore the inclusion of conditions based on the physical realizability of wave events and the use of multivariate linear regression to relate storm parameters to erosion computed from a process based model. Establishing a link between storm statistics and erosion consequences can resolve the ambiguity between multivariate storm return periods and associated erosion return periods.},

	abstract = {Abstract. In France, nuclear facilities were designed around very low probabilities of failure. Nevertheless, some extreme climatic events have given rise to exceptional observed surges (outliers) much larger than other observations, and have clearly illustrated the potential to underestimate the extreme water levels calculated with the current statistical methods. The objective of the present work is to conduct a comparative study of three approaches to extreme value analysis, including the annual maxima ({AM}), the peaks-over-threshold ({POT}) and the r-largest order statistics (r-{LOS}). These methods are illustrated in a real analysis case study. All data sets were screened for outliers. Non-parametric tests for randomness, homogeneity and stationarity of time series were used. The shape and scale parameter stability plots, the mean excess residual life plot and the stability of the standard errors of return levels were used to select optimal thresholds and r values for the {POT} and r-{LOS} method, respectively. The comparison of methods was based on (i) the uncertainty degrees, (ii) the adequacy criteria and tests, and (iii) the visual inspection. It was found that the r-{LOS} and {POT} methods have reduced the uncertainty on the distribution parameters and return level estimates and have systematically shown values of the 100 and 500-year return levels smaller than those estimated with the {AM} method. Results have also shown that none of the compared methods has allowed a good fit at the right tail of the distribution in the presence of outliers. As a perspective, the use of historical information was proposed in order to increase the representativeness of outliers in data sets. Findings are of practical relevance, not only to nuclear energy operators in France, for applications in storm surge hazard analysis and flood management, but also for the optimal planning and design of facilities to withstand extreme environmental conditions, with an appropriate level of risk.},

	abstract = {Abstract. Coastal facilities such as nuclear power plants ({NPPs}) have to be
designed to withstand extreme weather conditions and must, in particular, be
protected against coastal floods because it is the most important source of
coastal lowland inundations. Indeed, considering the combination of tide
and extreme storm surges ({SSs}) is a key issue in the evaluation of the risk
associated with coastal flooding hazard. Most existing studies are generally
based on the assumption that high tides and extreme {SSs} are
independent. While there are several approaches to analyze and characterize
coastal flooding hazard with either extreme {SSs} or sea levels, only few
studies propose and compare several approaches combining the tide density
with the {SS} variable. Thus this study aims to develop a method for modeling
dependence and coincidence of {SSs} and high tide. In this work, we have used
existing methods for tide and {SS} combination and tried to improve the
results by proposing a new alternative approach while showing the
limitations and advantages of each method. Indeed, in order to estimate
extreme sea levels, the classic joint probability method ({JPM}) is used by
making use of a convolution between tide and the skew storm surge ({SSS}).
Another statistical indirect analysis using the maximum instantaneous storm
surge ({MSS}) is proposed in this paper as an alternative to the first method
with the {SSS} variable. A direct frequency analysis using the extreme total
sea level is also used as a reference method. The question we are trying to
answer in this paper is then the coincidence and dependency essential for a
combined tide and {SS} hazard analysis. The results brought to light a bias in
the {MSS}-based procedure compared to the direct statistics on sea levels, and this
bias is more important for high return periods. It was also concluded that
an appropriate coincidence probability concept, considering the dependence
structure between {SSs}, is needed for a better assessment of the risk using
the {MSS}. The city of Le Havre in France was used as a case study. Overall,
the example has shown that the return level ({RL}) estimates using the {MSS}
variable are quite different from those obtained with the method using
the {SSSs}, with acceptable uncertainty. Furthermore, the shape parameter is
negative from all the methods with a much heavier tail when the {SSS} and the
extreme sea levels ({ESLs}) are used as variables of interest.},

	abstract = {Abstract. A good knowledge of extreme storm surges is necessary to ensure protection against flood. In this paper we introduce a methodology to determine time series of skew surges in France as well as a statistical approach for estimating extreme storm surges. With the aim to cope with the outlier issue in surge series, a regional frequency analysis has been carried out for the surges along the Atlantic coast and the Channel coast. This methodology is not the current approach used to estimate extreme surges in France. First results showed that the extreme events identified as outliers in at-site analyses do not appear to be outliers any more in the regional empirical distribution. Indeed the regional distribution presents a curve to the top with these extreme events that a mixed exponential distribution seems to recreate. Thus, the regional approach appears to be more reliable for some sites than at-site analyses. A fast comparison at a given site showed surge estimates with the regional approach and a mixed exponential distribution are higher than surge estimates with an at-site fitting. In the case of Brest, the 1000-yr return surge is 167 cm in height with the regional approach instead of 126 cm with an at-site analysis.},

            Explosive volcanism drives the Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation. 
          ,  
            Past research argues for an internal multidecadal (40- to 60-year) oscillation distinct from climate noise. Recent studies have claimed that this so-termed Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation is instead a manifestation of competing time-varying effects of anthropogenic greenhouse gases and sulfate aerosols. That conclusion is bolstered by the absence of robust multidecadal climate oscillations in control simulations of current-generation models. Paleoclimate data, however, do demonstrate multidecadal oscillatory behavior during the preindustrial era. By comparing control and forced “Last Millennium” simulations, we show that these apparent multidecadal oscillations are an artifact of pulses of volcanic activity during the preindustrial era that project markedly onto the multidecadal (50- to 70-year) frequency band. We conclude that there is no compelling evidence for internal multidecadal oscillations in the climate system.},

            Precipitation extremes will increase in a warming climate, but the response of flood magnitudes to heavier precipitation events is less clear. Historically, there is little evidence for systematic increases in flood magnitude despite observed increases in precipitation extremes. Here we investigate how flood magnitudes change in response to warming, using a large initial-condition ensemble of simulations with a single climate model, coupled to a hydrological model. The model chain was applied to historical (1961–2000) and warmer future (2060–2099) climate conditions for 78 watersheds in hydrological Bavaria, a region comprising the headwater catchments of the Inn, Danube and Main River, thus representing an area of expressed hydrological heterogeneity. For the majority of the catchments, we identify a ‘return interval threshold’ in the relationship between precipitation and flood increases: at return intervals above this threshold, further increases in extreme precipitation frequency and magnitude clearly yield increased flood magnitudes; below the threshold, flood magnitude is modulated by land surface processes. We suggest that this threshold behaviour can reconcile climatological and hydrological perspectives on changing flood risk in a warming climate.},

            An intensity–duration–frequency ({IDF}) curve describes the relationship between rainfall intensity and duration for a given return period and location. Such curves are obtained through frequency analysis of rainfall data and commonly used in infrastructure design, flood protection, water management, and urban drainage systems. However, they are typically available only in sparse locations. Data for other sites must be interpolated as the need arises. This paper describes how extreme precipitation of several durations can be interpolated to compute {IDF} curves on a large, sparse domain. In the absence of local data, a reconstruction of the historical meteorology is used as a covariate for interpolating extreme precipitation characteristics. This covariate is included in a hierarchical Bayesian spatial model for extreme precipitations. This model is especially well suited for a covariate gridded structure, thereby enabling fast and precise computations. As an illustration, the methodology is used to construct {IDF} curves over Eastern Canada. An extensive cross-validation study shows that at locations where data are available, the proposed method generally improves on the current practice of Environment and Climate Change Canada which relies on a moment-based fit of the Gumbel extreme-value distribution.},
